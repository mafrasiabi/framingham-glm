# Framingham Heart Study Analysis
## STAT 149 - Generalized Linear Models
## Jordan Turley

This is the final project from STAT 149 - Generalized Linear Models at Harvard University. I performed a study of data from the Framingham Heart Study using generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and tree-based models.

The code and data are located in [code/](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/framingham-glm/tree/master/code), the prompt and final report are in [report/](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/framingham-glm/tree/master/report), and plots used in the report are in [chd_vs_plots/](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/framingham-glm/tree/master/chd_vs_plots), [smooths/](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/framingham-glm/tree/master/smooths), and [trees/](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/framingham-glm/tree/master/trees).

### Usage

First, clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/framingham-glm

Next, run [code/final_project.R](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/framingham-glm/blob/master/code/final_project.R) using RStudio. When prompted, first select [code/na-convert.R](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/framingham-glm/blob/master/code/na-convert.R), and next select the data file [code/chd_risk.csv](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/framingham-glm/blob/master/code/chd_risk.csv).
